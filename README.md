The example of using RabbitMQ and AMQP
Cross-platform RabbitMq communication class based on AMQP-CPP

### Prerquisites
1. AMQP-CPP: https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/AMQP-CPP
2. Boost library v.1.66 or 1.67 not newer, or boost Asio (for Windows you should use prbuild binaries)


### Cross-platform

The bottom layer uses the cross-platform Boost Asio library for network IO, so it can be ported across platforms.

References and comments are welcome.
